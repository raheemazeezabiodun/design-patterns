#### What are design patterns
I tend to see design patterns as a thought process that developers implement when solving a problem

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern), `design pattern is a general, reusable solution to a commonly occuring problem within a given context in software design.`

Design patterns are not psuedo codes, they are templates on how to solve a problem. A good reason why design pattern is very useful is that, there's consistency across the source code, it helps other team members understand the thought process of solutions implemented better.

Design patterns are meant to address how your functions, classes, modules relate with each other. 


#### Why are they needed
1. Since programmers are regarded as authors (We just don't write code for the computer but also for humans to read), design patterns help readability of code
2. Design patterns gives you an approach to solve problems using a proven solution
3. Since high cohesion and minimal coupling is one of the princicples of clean code, design patterns facilitates your code structure in such manner
